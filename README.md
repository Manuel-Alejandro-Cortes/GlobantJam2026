Belong is a game where you embody a character who is not accepted by society for being different. In a world that demands conformity, the protagonist is seen as a mistake, someone who must be hidden away.

Hunted down to be taken to a mental institution, your only chance is to escape and collect the pieces of a mask that will allow you to appear “normal” and finally be accepted.

Time is against you.
You must find all the pieces before time runs out or before being captured by the enemies who relentlessly chase you.

The game is controlled using the arrow keys, and blends exploration, tension, and survival, confronting the player with an uncomfortable question:

How much of who we are must we change in order to belong?
